Rather than simply replicating existing experiences in a digital environment, I delve into the core user needs, experiences, and goals to leverage technology in innovative ways that traditional mediums cannot.",

As a PhD candidate at University College London, my area of research has expanded to explore to encompass the fields of public mental health and how the introduction of affective interaction principals and machines learning can benefit us as a society."

My dissertation involved designing an LLM-based information seeking platform specifically for people living with ALS—both in design and content. I solicited input from a medical professionals, assistive technologists and people living with ALS, as well as caregivers and high-level leaders at the International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations to create and evaluate a solution that reflected the needs of all stakeholders. I continue to work in accessible and inclusive technology as a research assistant at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, conducting participatory design research with psychologists and LGBTQ+ individuals to develop an AI-based therapeutic tool.

Inspired by how users might trust differently when presented with hallucinatory responses from converational and GenAI such as ChatGPT, my MSc research focused on examining user trust in a chatbot embedded with credibility cues. What happens when a chatbot presenting itself as credible provides false information to users? These were some questions my research aim to answer. "
